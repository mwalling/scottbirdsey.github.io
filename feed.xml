&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-glue-some-tire-on-the-bottom-of-your-left-shoe&quot;&gt;1. Glue some tire on the bottom of your left shoe.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cycle-smart.com/cyclocross-camps/&quot;&gt;Adam Myerson’s excellent cross camp&lt;/a&gt; teaches riders to dismount by unclipping the left foot &lt;em&gt;one crank revolution before&lt;/em&gt; unclipping the right foot. Tire tread epoxied on the foot sole behind the cleat gives your foot a nice snug grip - you can even pedal that way. Generally, this will set you up for a more bullet-proof and faster dismount. It’s been working out great particularly when planks are set up on a straightaway, giving me time to execute the most perfect and speedy form that I can. Even if you don’t do this, why not glue some tire on your shoe? There’s no downside to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-check-your-brake-pads-use-the-right-brake-pads&quot;&gt;2. Check your brake pads. Use the right brake pads.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Agent Dale Cooper advises: “Every day, once a day, give yourself a little present.” To that end, I’ve been conducting a much more thorough bike inspection following race days this year, even pulling out calipers to check brake pads if I feel the need &lt;em&gt;(you want at least 2.5mm of material including the backing plate, on a SRAM Force pad)&lt;/em&gt;. Did you know brake pad material can be a big thing in cyclocross? At &lt;a href=&quot;https://topshots.smugmug.com/2017/BCA-Cyclocross-2017/i-NP97z5c&quot;&gt;BCA Cyclocross this year&lt;/a&gt;, I destroyed my organic pads after the first two laps of racing, due to all the mud and water. I’ve since purchased a separate set of sintered pads, which I plan to swap in conditions like these, while cheaper organic pads will be used the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-mini-tire-pressure-checker--pump-on-prerides&quot;&gt;3. Mini tire pressure checker &amp;amp; pump on prerides.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont keep a full on notebook of pressures I run at races or anything intense like that, but I find it really useful to always start with the same pressure, and adjust from there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gravelbike.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gauges-composite.jpg&quot;&gt;This mini pressure checker&lt;/a&gt; - while not as cool as the hashtag-pro Craftsmen gun - is cheap and works great. It can be found pretty easily online. When I pre-ride, I carry it with a mini pump, on the offchance I want to make fast adjustments. I’ve seen a few mini pumps that include a gauge in them, but this is cheap and does the job well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-grab-your-front-brake-to-pop-your-downtube-up-for-a-bike-shoulder&quot;&gt;4. Grab your front brake to pop your downtube up for a bike shoulder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this nifty little trick from the badonkers-ly skilled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/iamscottsmith/&quot;&gt;Scott Smith&lt;/a&gt; from JAM Fund. There’s plenty of techniques (and variants upon on those techniques to shoulder a bike), and obviously it’s preference. Me, I tend to grab my downtube and hoist the bike onto the shoulder. In some conditions, giving the front brake a squeeze works great for getting the downtube closer to my hand. Obviously, this is more of a slow-speed trick, and you can’t do it if you’re a brake-swapper (some racers like to put their rear brake on the left hood to safely scrub speed before a dismount).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-pull-your-crank-after-wet-races&quot;&gt;5. Pull your crank after wet races.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this common knowledge? I picked it up from the amazing Bike Shop CX podcast on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wideanglepodium.com/category/bike-shop-cx/&quot;&gt;Wide Angle Podium network&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s really wet, I do it, and leave it overnight. It’s fun to sweat things like this - I didn’t used to be that guy. I’m glad I’m that guy now. The guy that makes time for these matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-core-work-is-the-best-work&quot;&gt;6. Core work is the best work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a sensitive lower back from a distant motorcycle accident, and used to just generally sometimes feel beat up after a cross race, but that no longer happens now after keeping up with ten-minute core workouts on weekdays. Other than a much more resolute body that can take the bumpy stuff in stride, my sprints feel like a much more connected effort of my upper and lower body. Helen Wyman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BYBP_NLguAS/?taken-by=cxhelen&quot;&gt;recently shared her core exercise regimen&lt;/a&gt;, and mine are about the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-whats-next&quot;&gt;7. What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All is well in my world and I am safe. What’s next?” Even the most chill of all the bike racers can plummet down a mental hole when the going gets rough. I reckon that’s particularly true in cyclocross, where there can be drama waiting around every corner. Keep that mantra in mind for when it all gets upside down. And in case you haven’t heard this one yet: never, ever, quit!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="bike racing" /><summary type="html">Dry and hot racing at KMC this year (with a dubiously bloody finger?)

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#crossiscoming – As I write this in late August, about every other image in my Instagram feed is currently labeled as such. That strange and beautiful thing called cyclocross is upon us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Cross is labeled a niche sport, and understandably so. The average American, no matter how athletically-inclined, is unlikely to have a reference point. We’re working on it. For a convert like myself, there’s no shortage of imagery I can share: bright lycra skinsuits dulled by spatterings of mud, the snaking geometry of course tape through a park, the mad ravings of course announcers calling the action, all saturated in that romantically crisp bliss of Northeast autumn air. And the adrenaline of the race. Oh man, the adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/jump-into-cyclocross/2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Uncle Sam Grand Prix, part of the NYCROSS Series, takes place October 7-8 in Troy’s Prospect Park. &lt;em&gt;Photo: Mary Zawacki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s all get on the same page: ‘cross happens in a park, where a course has been constructed out of staked race tape, creating a three-mile loop about the width of a lane of road. Grass, dirt, sand, ruts, off-camber, hairpin turns, and if it rains there’s mud. Later there’s snow. I won’t soon forget the experience of racing a bike in lycra in 25-degree weather at CX Nationals in Hartford, Conn., last year. It all happens with your heart pumping at an unreasonable speed, and a crowd of spectators urging you to go faster, and catch the wheel ahead of you. It’s weird, it’s fun, it’s communal and it’s addictive. The whole race day is a big party, where you can relax and enjoy food and beverages with friends after your race. You need to see it for yourself – good thing there’s YouTube! I highly recommend looking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/H9hUiGyw_lg?t=1m28s&quot;&gt;the 2017 Elite Women’s World Championship in Bieles, Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what’s awesome? In upstate New York, we’re in a hotbed of American cross, and 2017 is going to be bigger than ever, with races of every size happening almost every weekend. Get on bikereg.com and see for yourself! If you’re new to the sport and wanting to dip a toe in, most local cycling clubs will have a connection to a local practice or clinic going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/jump-into-cyclocross/3.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Wicked Creepy Cross in Bennington, Vt., features a signature costume lap as a brief respite from the real race action. &lt;em&gt;Photo: Don Massone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grassroots races are the lifeblood of cyclocross, and happen all over our region. Expect most of the fields to peak at about 20 to 30 racers, but expect no shortness of quality or passion in the experience. In the Capital Region and surrounding area, we run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nycross.com&quot;&gt;NYCROSS Race Series&lt;/a&gt; that’s in its 12th year. The series stretches over the course of the fall: Kirkland Cyclocross on September 9 in Clinton (near Utica); Uncle Sam Cyclocross GP on October 7-8 in Troy; Wicked Creepy Cross on October 29 in Bennington, Vt.; and Bethlehem Cup on November 19 in Delmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the western New York scene on one side and the masses of New England racers on the other, the NYCROSS races tend to get a nice mash-up of different regional crowds. Each of our courses are like a fine wine, having been aged and perfected over the years, and we couldn’t be prouder of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those central and western New Yorkers are doing big things too, and you’ll find no shortage of races from Syracuse to Buffalo. In fact, Rochester is the site of the &lt;a href=&quot;rochestercyclocross.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;very first American UCI race on September 9-10 at Genesee Valley Park, and will feature several of the biggest domestic names at the pro level. There’s nothing like watching the pros race on the very same course that you raced on earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;cidercross.com&quot;&gt;Cider Cross&lt;/a&gt;, which is held outside Syracuse on an apple orchard – what’s more bucolic than that! – will host New York’s annual Cyclocross Championship on November 5 at the Beak &amp;amp; Skiff Apple Orchard, where the coveted NYS Champion jerseys will be awarded for various racing categories by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nysbra.com&quot;&gt;New York Bicycle Racing Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to New England. I personally will be driving over the Berkshires several times this season to get my legs ripped off by the unbridled talent that comprises New England bike racing culture. Arguably the cradle of American CX, Massachusetts and Connecticut have some major events happening this year that are helping to take the American movement to even greater heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kmccrossfest.com&quot;&gt;KMC Cross Fest&lt;/a&gt; on the September 28 to October 1 weekend at the Thompson Speedway in Thompson, Conn. It’s a four-day festival that features Gran Fondo New England, races for everyone, and big vendor presence, KMC is now one of four races selected to be part of a brand new US Cyclocross Cup supported by USA Cycling. This series offers major cash and prestige, so expect pro races for men and women at KMC to be lit! Remember – this isn’t a road race – because it’s on a closed course, spectating a cross race is honestly almost as exhilarating as racing yourself. It hurts a whole lot less, but don’t expect to have much of a speaking voice leftover if it’s a tight race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;NBX, in Warwick, RI: that beach run, tho. &lt;em&gt;Photo: Don Massone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real gran-daddy of them all is Adam Myerson’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://necyclocross.com&quot;&gt;Vittoria Northeast Cyclocross Series&lt;/a&gt;, a four-event series that takes athletes to Gloucester, Mass. on October 14-15; Northampton, Mass. on November 11-12; Suffern, NY on November 18-19; and Warwick, RI on December 2-3. The series has been one of the standard-bearers stateside for years. Learn more at necyclocross.com. With major sponsors onboard, these races will feel like scaled-up versions of their grassroots brethren – the same communal passion, but more of everything – race fields swell to over 100 in a field, courses are more varied, and everyone brings their best legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclocross is unparalleled in localism and inclusiveness, qualities that are indispensable in this brave new world of fake news and fidget spinners! It’s happening near you in a public park, where you can watch the race unfold all around you. Bring your dogs, bring your kids, and bring some cash for a tasty post-race treat from the local food truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hopeful amateurs that treat each race with the seriousness of a moon launch (guilty), and there are characters donning costumes to heckle friends so bring on the LOLs. And hey, riding around on grass means slower speeds than races of the road variety, which means that it’s for all ages, and all levels of sanity. Crashing out in a race hurts substantially less on grass at 10 mph than on pavement at 25 mph – ask me how I know!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="bike racing" /><summary type="html">This article was originally published in ADK Sports.

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, this race predictor thingie doesn’t look bad, I’m predicted at 10th, so maybe I’ll shoot for a top five. And I haven’t seen this course yet, but maybe tenth will give me a first-row callup!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-preride&quot;&gt;The preride&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm, woah, this course has a lot of turns in it! The terrain is this weird, loose, loam-ey type stuff. This will be really good cornering experience for me, especially so early in the season, but I’m totally going to fall on this stuff. It reminds me of NBX, and that went &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt;. But stay on the bright side, eh? I mean, it was a genius decision to do the file tread in the rear and the Grifo up front - yeah, the front will help me carve those turns and bring the file tread right through.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-call-up&quot;&gt;The call-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh hey, everyone is here already…[waits]…okay, the tape is being removed and it’s time for call-ups…wait, what? There’s no call-ups, it’s just a mass start with whomever in front getting to start in front?! How did I miss this?! Was it on the BikeReg page? This is really terrible, I’m way back here in the third row, with about twenty people in front of me. This is a &lt;em&gt;disaster&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-first-lap&quot;&gt;The first lap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re starting! I’m sprinting well, but the guy in front of me isn’t, and all these people are passing us. I’m going to have to go &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; if I’m going to meet my top five goal. I’m going to start passing people ASAP, even though we’re going into single-track woods.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh yep, I just put down way too much power over this rooted section and yard-saled all over the course! It’s good that my adrenaline is so lit right now that I can’t feel anything! Just get back up and keep fighting, there’s plenty of racing left. But I wonder how much further up the race-leaders are. Will I be able to catch them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-second-lap&quot;&gt;The second lap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um, what, my front tire is flat? The tubular I glued last week? &lt;em&gt;Fuck&lt;/em&gt;. I should probably quit now before I damage myself or my bike more. It’d be for the best, right? But the pit just happened to be right here in front of me, and I did put some spare wheels there, so I may as well swap a wheel and keep going. I can’t quit, that’s not me. Yeah, my goals for today are out the door, but I’m not a wasteful dude – I can just turn this into another awesome learning experience. But also: Is cyclocross just something I’ll never be good at? Should I take up badminton instead? And what about all these long hours of training I’ve done – why am I in the back of the race? This is &lt;em&gt;so unfair&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-finish-line&quot;&gt;The finish line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wow, I made it – and those last two laps felt pretty comfortable. It was like I stopped thinking everything except what was right in front of me in the present. That was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much easier, and it was fun, too – I slowly passed people one by one, but I didn’t make silly mistakes because I was too anxious to pass more. So how can I start focusing on the present from the race start?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-yeah-racing-cross-its-all-mental&quot;&gt;So yeah, racing cross, it’s all mental&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve read it a zillion times in books, but after today it’s never been more clear that competition is mostly mental, and that life in general is pretty difficult when you’re not living in the present moment. I can see that one setback – not being placed for an ideal start - led me down a path of worry and anxiety. It felt good to air it all out on here though! And that last question – how can I start focusing on the present from the race start – I don’t know the answer, but I’m going to find it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="bike racing" /><summary type="html">The night before</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Weidt Group</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writes/weidt" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Weidt Group" /><published>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writes/weidt</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writes/weidt">&lt;p&gt;TWG&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">TWG</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Capital Bicycle Racing Club</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writes/cbrc" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Capital Bicycle Racing Club" /><published>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writes/cbrc</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writes/cbrc">&lt;p&gt;CBRC Kit, website, logo&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">CBRC Kit, website, logo</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Night on Buddy’s Bench website</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writes/buddys-bench" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Night on Buddy's Bench website" /><published>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writes/buddys-bench</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writes/buddys-bench">&lt;p&gt;A Night on Buddy’s Bench&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A Night on Buddy’s Bench</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Farmer’s Daughter Logo and Jersey</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writes/farmers-daughter" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Farmer's Daughter Logo and Jersey" /><published>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writes/farmers-daughter</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writes/farmers-daughter">&lt;p&gt;Farmer’s Daughter, logo, jersey&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Farmer’s Daughter, logo, jersey</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">dr pilates</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writes/dr-pilates" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="dr pilates" /><published>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-22T18:48:24-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writes/dr-pilates</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writes/dr-pilates">&lt;p&gt;dr Pilates website&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">dr Pilates website</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Joy Division cycling legwarmers</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writes/joy-divions" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Joy Division cycling legwarmers" /><published>2015-07-20T18:48:24-04:00</published><updated>2015-07-20T18:48:24-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writes/joy-divions</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writes/joy-divions">&lt;p&gt;Joy Division legwarmers&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Joy Division legwarmers</summary></entry></feed>
