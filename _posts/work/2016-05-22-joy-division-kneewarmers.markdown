I always got joy from fashion and gear, so it seems obvious now that cycling was a good fit for me. 

In 2015, when I first got a bike and started riding it, I realized after a few group rides that you could be fashionable on a bike, the same way you can in a club or in a supermarket. It wasn't just exercising in a Planet Fitness. My initial confusion that cycling was a sport, rather than a culture, is comical, now.

I ordered twenty of these produced, mostly out of a curiosity as to the process, and an interest in making friends. Unbeknownst to me at the time, several other apparel companies were making jerseys and other items with the pulsar pattern. I'm not sure whether they intended to be a nod to Joy Division. Mine certainly were.

Ultimately, the project was a success, because I sold them all, at cost, to new acquaintances, all of which have become friends since.
