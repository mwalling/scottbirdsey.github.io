lede: A lean, one-page website for a growing Los Angeles pilates brand.

<a href="http://drpilatersla.com">Drpilates</a> is a Los Angeles pilates studio that contacted me in the months prior to opening up shop. Doug, the owner, was after a website for his business-to-be that would be lean and tailored.

I provided a strategy and design for the website - a simple one-page design, with a look and feel based off of his only existing brand assets: a logo. Doug had a really clear picture of what he wanted to say about his business, and I acted as a conduit to organize that content into sections of the website, and even did a lot of the initial copywriting.

I would end up building out the design into a responsive and standards-compliant website, with a bit of special code that would display the studio schedule from a third-party web applicationâ€™s API, called Mindbody.
