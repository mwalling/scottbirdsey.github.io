<a href="http://anightonbuddysbench.com">A Night on Buddy's Bench</a> is a book about the end of life, experienced by one man. I worked with the author closely to try and create a website that captured the tone and mood of the book. 

The book is beautifully illustrated with watercolors, so we tried to work those into the website itself as much as possible. Additionally, I created a nifty little audio player for visitors to hear an excerpt of the audiobook.

The site was created in Wordpress with the intention of the author keeping a blog. To handle the e-commerce, we used a nice lightweight plugin from Shopify, keeping budget down.
