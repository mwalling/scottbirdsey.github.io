        <p>Deactivated the Facebook account. In my profile feed this morning, a Facebook friend had shared a video of someone calling himself the “virtual president”. In the video, the virtual president was speaking of the dangers of gun control, an agenda of falsehood perpreated by the politicians in power. Crime control, the viurtual president claimed, was the real answer. The video was cut with stolen scenes of the US Congress in earnest listening - Paul Ryan and others - to make the scene look real to those who may not be giving it their full attention. Or those who want it to be real.</p>

<p>The subtext that chills me isn’t really in the content of that video, disturbing as it is, but in <em>the act of the ”share“</em>.</p>

<p>I remember in 2003 as an 18-year-old when Faceook came rolling through the dorms of NYU. What an exciting time that must have been for those early engineers and designers in Palo Alto. I didn’t sign up then – didn’t like that it put me in a grid. But I created an account five years later, when it became too tempting to know what those I had crossed paths with previously in life were up to now.</p>

<p>What a thing it has become since then. I don’t feel I fully understand it; not in a way I could write about it presently.</p>

<p>Leaving Facebook may be difficult – for sure will I have to play a more active role in seeking out information on many levels. I’ll certainly have to play a more active role in communicating with friends and family. A challenge I think will do me an immeasurable amount of good. Damn, it feels good to be free of Facebook.</p>
