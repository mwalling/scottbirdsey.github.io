        <p>I made my first personal website on Angelfire when I was about fifteen. Over the years, numerous personal band and DJ-related websites followed. It’s nice to have a home, and a few months in, this one is really starting to give me joy.</p>

<h1 id="code">Code</h1>

<p>I’ve experimented with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> here and there over the past few years, and this is my first published website using it - what an engine Jekyll is! It seems willing to do whatever you’d like it to do, and uses metadata and templating to make wonderful organization and presentation systems</p>

<p>But, with no database comes its own constraints. I host the website for free with Github pages, but am storing the <em>full</em> code (other than just the static site Jekyll produces) in a separate branch, so that I can work on the site from any computer if need be. Things get a bit complicated with deployment - I have to make use of a <em>Git sub-tree</em>, which I still quite honestly don’t fully understand yet, and, well, sometimes run into merge issues with. But it’s free.</p>

<h1 id="design">Design</h1>

<p>The theme I’ve created is called <em>Unicorn Sundae</em>, because this is my website and I get to have fun. It’s pretty basic - no Javascript at the time of writing this. I’m using <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/financier-text/">Financier</a> by the Klim Foundry, and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind">Hind</a> from Google Webfonts (saving those pennies for some more Klim fonts!).</p>

<p>For me, it’ll be fun to see how the theme develops as time and gumption permit. Thus far, I’ve put all my focus into providing good readability and accessibility. I look forward to some expressive design efforts – something one always hopes to include in a website.</p>

<p>I hope that <em>you</em> find it worthy – feel free to drop me a line about anything related to it.</p>
